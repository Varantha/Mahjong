Method to convert one line string tiles format to the 136 array, like
"123s456p789m11222z". 's' stands for sou, 'p' stands for pin,
'm' stands for man and 'z' or 'h' stands for honor.
You can pass r or 0 instead of 5 for it to become a red five from
that suit. To prevent old usage without red,
has_aka_dora has to be True for this to do that.


What is needed for hand_calculating: 
- tiles object
- win_tile object
- melds object
- hand_config object
- OptionalRules object

Agari outputs: 
- Tiles in 123spm format
- melds in 123spm format
  - Tiles in the weird order
  - marker for called tile

- openHand
- winningTile
